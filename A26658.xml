            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>AN Office was found and returned in the Chancery, That a Copyhold in <hi>Iſlington</hi> was 14 <hi>Car.</hi> granted to one <hi>John Holland</hi> and his Heirs at the will of the Lord, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in truſt for one <hi>Margaret Taylor</hi> (who was an Alien) and her Heirs; and that the profits were diſpoſed according to the truſt, and that after <hi>M. T.</hi> died: and this was by virtue of a Commiſſion to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire what Lands, <hi>&amp;c. M. T.</hi> had, and the Commiſſioners ſeiſed the Land; whereupon <hi>Holland</hi> came and ſhewed his Title, and traverſed the ſeiſin in truſt for <hi>M. T.</hi> And Iſſue being joyned, it was found for the King; and note the <hi>Venire facias</hi> was awarded in the Chancery retornable in this Court, and the Record ſent hither, (for they try no Iſſue there.) And exception was taken to the Writ becauſe it was <hi>quorum quilibet habet</hi> 4. <hi>libratas terrae,</hi> and according to Stat. 27 <hi>El. cap.</hi> 6. which extends only to this Court <hi>C. B.</hi> Exchequer and Iuſtices of Aſſiſe: to which it was answered, That foraſmuch as it is returnable in this Court, it is well enough within the Statute; but that An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer was not allowed: but becauſe this Clauſe was added by the Statute of 35 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 7. which was in the affirmative, that the Writ ſhould continue <hi>quorum quilibet habet</hi> 2. <hi>libratas terrae.</hi> And the Statute 27 <hi>El.</hi> adds that it ſhall be 4. <hi>libratas</hi> in ſuch Courts, but no negative words in either Statute; therefore it is but <hi>abundans cautela,</hi> and makes not the Writ vicious. And <hi>Roll</hi> ſaid that it was ſo adjudged <hi>Mich.</hi> 21 <hi>Jac.</hi> betwéen <hi>Philpot</hi> and <hi>Feilder.</hi> The Queſtions in Law were, 1. If the King ſhould have the truſt: 2. If by virtue of that he might ſeiſe the Land: 3. If the Caſe differ'd, becauſe Copyhold. And it was argued the laſt Term by <hi>Mountague</hi> for <hi>Holland,</hi> and <hi>Hale</hi> for the King; and this Term by <hi>Maynard</hi> for <hi>Holland,</hi> and <hi>Twiſden</hi> for the King.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That Vſes at the Common Law were things partly in action, ſo that they were not given to the King by general words of Hereditaments in Statutes, as is agréed in the Marqueſs of <hi>Wincheſter</hi>'s Caſe. And they conſiſted in privity, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore could not be transferred by act in Law, as by eſcheat for Attainder, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And the preamble of the Statute of 27 <hi>H.</hi> 8.
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:65497:11"/> which reduces the poſſeſſion to the Vſe, recites that by convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances to Vſe, the King loſt his eſcheats and purchaſes of Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens, <hi>&amp;c. l.</hi> 1. 124. <hi>a.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now Truſts being of the ſame nature at this day, they are ruled according as Vſes were at the Common Law; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if a Woman conveys a term in Truſt for her ſelf, and takes Husband and dies, he ſhall not have the Truſt by ſurvivorſhip, but the Adminiſtrators of the Wife ſhould have it. 4. <hi>Inſt.</hi> 87. <hi>a. Witham</hi>'s Caſe. (But <hi>Roll</hi> ſaid that it hath béen ſince reſolved that the Husband ſhall have it in that caſe.) And <hi>Mainard</hi> ſaid that the Alien himſelf had no remedy in equity for the Vſe at Common Law, nor for a Truſt at this day; for he could not compell the Feoffees to execute it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If the King ſhould have the Truſt yet he cannot ſeiſe the Land by Law, for the Alien himſelf had not that power; his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, if he ſhould have any, was only in the Chancery.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Land it ſelf being Copyhold, the King cannot have it. 1. Becauſe it is not transferrable by act in Law without the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of the Lord, for the prejudice that may accrue to him in loſing his Fine, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 2. Becauſe the King cannot perform the ſervices incident to the Tenure; and yet in default thereof, the L. could not take advantage of the forfeiture as againſt the King.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It would be an injury to ſtrangers that ſhould have right to the Copyhold; for the King is not to be impleded in the Lords Court where only remedy is to be taken.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Eſtate is too baſe for the King to hold.</p>
               <p>On the contrary it was ſaid,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the King ſhould have had a Vſe limited to an Alien at the Common Law, and by the ſame reaſon that he was to have the Land purchaſed by Aliens, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Realm ſhould not be impoveriſhed by ſtrangers; and Vſes at the Common Law were not properly things in action, but Inheritances deſcendible by the rules of the Common Law, and would have paſſed by grant or deviſe by the name of Hereditaments, as <hi>Hale</hi> ſaid. And he ſaid that the preamble of the Statute of 27 <hi>H.</hi> 8. is not to be intended as though the King ſhould not have remedy for the profits when the Vſe was diſcovered, but that the Lands were ſo craftily conveyed that the Vſe could not be diſcovered. Now the caſe is the ſame of a Truſt.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:65497:12"/>2. The King be virtue of this Truſt may ſeiſe the Land; for though the profits only are given him by the Truſt, yet he hath not any direct means to be ſatisfied of thoſe profits unleſs he may ſeiſe the Land. And therefore 5 <hi>H.</hi> 5. 3. where a Manor with an advowſon appendant was granted to the uſe of one who was after outlawed, and upon an avoidance the King brought a <hi>Quare impedit,</hi> and had a Writ to the Biſhop. And <hi>Hales</hi> ſaid that 19 <hi>Jac.</hi> in Sir <hi>John Dacke</hi>'s Caſe, <hi>in Scaccar'</hi> to whom the King granted a term to the uſe of the Lord, who was attainted of Felony: upon great deliberation with all the Iudges it was reſolved, and accordingly decréed, that the Truſt ſhould be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited to the King, and the intereſt of Sir <hi>John</hi> alſo.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Now that the Eſtate of the Copyholder is fixed by the Cuſtome, there is the ſame reaſon for that as for any other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance. And this Term the Court took an exception to the Commiſſion, which was only to enquire what Lands, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lien had, but no <hi>Capias in manus</hi> in it; and therefore it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved that the ſeiſure was unduly made, and therefore they did not openly declare their opinion upon the matter in Law. But <hi>Bacon</hi> ſaid that an Alien at the Common Law could not compell the Feoffees to execute an Vſe: And <hi>Roll</hi> ſaid, that though the King ſhould have the Vſe, yet he could not ſeiſe the Land it ſelf by Law, but by equity he might have a Decrée for the Land: and ſo was Sir <hi>John Dack</hi>'s Caſe. And the Court doubted what Iudgment ſhould be given, the Verdict being found for the King. And the rule was, that <hi>ceſſet intratio judicii, &amp;c.</hi> for they held that they could not give any Iudgment, but afterward <hi>Termino Paſchae</hi> 24 <hi>Car.</hi> the opinion of the Court being changed, they directed the Caſe ſhould be argued. And <hi>Hale</hi> argued for the King, that no Iudgment could be given againſt him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Record of the Inquiſition is ſtill remaining in the Chancery: and this Court hath no power to procéed, but only to trial of the Iſſue, and upon the Verdict, for the very Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord as to that is in this Court (and yet he ſaid that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord after the Trial hath béen remanded into the Chancery, and Iudgment given there) but the tenour only of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition is here, as appears by the Entry, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but if it had béen brought in <hi>per manus proprias</hi> of the Kéeper of the Great Seal, then the whole Record had béen here, and ſo Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhould have béen given upon the whole Record. And he took this difference, that when the tenour of a Record being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, the Court where the Original Record reſides cannot proceed, then the Court where the tenour is may procéed upon
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:65497:12"/> the tenour. And therefore if the tenour of a Fine be certified upon a <hi>Certiorari</hi> out of the Tower or Treaſury into the Chance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and ſent into the Common Pleas by <hi>Mittimus,</hi> Execution may be awarded there upon the tenour 39 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 4. <hi>a.</hi> So if the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of a Iudgment in a Writ of Annuity be certified out of the reſcript in the Common Pleas into the Chancery, and ſent thither by <hi>Mittimus</hi> they may award execution there upon the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour 34 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 2. <hi>d.</hi> becauſe in thoſe caſes there are no other Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices that can proceed upon the Record it ſelf, but where the Iudges where the very Record reſides may procéed thereupon, notwithſtanding any tenour certified in ſuch caſes, there can be no proceeding upon the tenour: As if the tenour of a Iudgment in ancient demeſn be certified in Chancery, and ſent by <hi>Mittimus</hi> into the Common Pleas, no <hi>Scire facias</hi> lieth thereupon; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Court of Ancient Demeſn may ſtill procéed to execution upon the Record it ſelf. 39 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 3. <hi>h. &amp;c.</hi> So in our caſe the Chancery may ſtill procéed to ſeiſure upon the Inquiſition, affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming it to be good. 14 <hi>E.</hi> 4. 7. <hi>a.</hi> And therefore this Court can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not procéed upon the tenour of it, for thence might enſue a claſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Courts; the one affirming it, and the other quaſhing it: and for theſe reaſons he prayed that the former rule might ſtand. But it was anſwered by <hi>Maynard,</hi> and reſolved by the Court, that Iudgment ought to be given againſt the King, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the whole Record is virtually here, otherwiſe they ſhould be bound up to the Verdict, ſo that Iudgment ſhould be given ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that, though it appear upon the whole Record that the King had no Title. And both the Iudges denied that the Chancery could proceed upon the Inquiſition, now that the ſame was ſent hither upon the Traverſe, but that the Iudgment in this Court would utterly ſubvert the Inquiſition: And therefore Iudgment was given <hi>quod manus Domini Regis amoveantur.</hi>

               <p>But it was reſolved that the requeſt was well made: for 1.

The requeſt

               <p n="1">1. Becauſe the Defendant hath not answered to one quarters Rent.</p>
               <p n="2">2.

And the Court inclined, that it was no principal challenge; but for want of ſufficient proof it fell off, and the Court
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:65497:19"/> would not examine him upon a <hi>voir dire</hi> after it. Another was challenged by the Defendant, and being upon his Trial, <hi>ſoit treit,</hi> ſaid the Plaintiff, but not allowed; for that muſt be upon the Challenge, and not upon the Trial, and therefore he was tried and sworn.</p>
               <p>And the Caſe upon the Evidence was, that Tenant in <hi>Capite</hi> of certain Lands, and the Houſe in queſtion, conveyed all (as it was found by Office) to his youngeſt Son, and died, his eldeſt Son and Heir being within age, who attained to his full age, and died before livery ſued. And the younger Son entred, and made a Leaſe to the Plaintiff of the whole Land; and whether this Leaſe was good for the whole, was the queſtion. And the Plaintiff's Counſel offered to prove by another Office, that other Lands were left to deſcend to the eldeſt Son, which were more then a full third part of the whole Lands the Tenant had: but it was not allowed, for the Office wherein the Houſe in queſtion is found, is a Record by it ſelf, and the King's Title muſt be taken as it is found in that, and not as it ſtands by compariſon with another Office.<note place="margin">1 H. 7. 5. c.</note> 2. It was a queſtion, whether a Leaſe made by the younger Son in this caſe before ſeiſure (for none could be proved) were not good for the whole. And it was holden to be void as to a third part, and ſo it was, though the third part were not ſet out by the Statute; for the King's intereſt commenced by the Office before ſeiſure, and before ſetting out of the third part. 3.<note place="margin">Stamf. 35. c. l. 8. 175. c. 13 H. 4. 3. g. h. 14. a. 1 H. 7. 5. c. 21 H. 7. 7. b.</note> It was agreed, that the Land continued in the King's hands for a third part, till an <hi>ouſter le maine</hi> ſued, though the Heir were dead. 4.

And it was moved in arreſt of Iudgment that the Traverſe was naught. 1.

Becauſe the Traverſe is larger then the Avowry, for <hi>adhuc eſt,</hi> refers to the time of the pleading, which is more then is alledged, or then is material. To the firſt it was answered, that though it be not formal, yet it is ſubſtantial enough; for if the Son were not ſeiſed, there could be no diſcent to him, and therefore it is made good by the Verdict; and the Court inclined to this opinion. But the other exception was holden to be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial.

L.</hi> his Heirs or Aſſigns, <hi>vel aliquar' perſonar' clamantium per praed' M.L. haered' vel aſſignat' ſuos vel per eorum medium conſenſum vel procurationem, niſi, &amp;c.</hi> and aſſigns for breach, that one <hi>Mich. Clavel clamans titulum à praed' M. L. poſtea, ſcil.</hi> 20. <hi>Feb.</hi> 17 <hi>Car.</hi> did enter upon him, and eject him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the Defendant pleads <hi>plene adminiſtravit,</hi> and Iſſue being joyned thereupon, the Iury found that Sir <hi>M. L.</hi> 15. <hi>Jun.</hi> 1634. made his Will, and made the Defendant his Executor; and by the ſame Will, <hi>dedit di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſa legata bonorum in ſpecie ſeparalibus perſonis in dicto Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mento nominatis, ac poſtea obiit, poſt cujus mortem,</hi> the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant 11 <hi>Car. bona praed' ſic ut praefertur in ſpecie dat' ad valen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam</hi> 500 <hi>li. in executionem Teſtamenti praed' praed' ſeparalibus perſonis in eodem Teſtamento nominat' deliberavit,</hi> and find the breach of Covenant to be ſix years after, and that no other Goods of the Teſtators came to the hands of the Defendant: <hi>&amp; ſi, &amp;c. pro querent', &amp;c.</hi> And the Caſe was argued by <hi>Green</hi> and <hi>Latch ex parte querentis</hi> that the Goods delivered for Lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies are Aſſets in the Executors hands, as to this contingent Covenant.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the Executors ſhall be intended conuſant of all Contracts and Duties of the Teſtators, as well preſent as fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as well contingent as certain; and that therefore this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingent Covenant lay as a charge upon the Teſtator's Eſtate.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That ſuch contingent Covenants are common aſſurances much favoured in Law, which may all be eaſily defeated, if the diſpoſition of the Covenants by his Will ſhould ſtand good againſt them; for though the Executors ſhould afterwards voluntarily break them, yet the recompence muſt be had only out of the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtator's Eſtate.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A diverſity was taken between Debts without ſpecialty, and
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:65497:23"/> Legacies, for thoſe are duties of the ſame nature with Debts upon ſpecialty, but differ only in order and dignity; but theſe are meer gratuities, for which no Action lieth at the Common Law; and therefore are not taken notice of by Law as duties, but the remedy for them is in the Court Chriſtian.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Executor was not compellable by the Eccleſiaſtical Court to pay theſe Legacies, unleſs the Legatees in this caſe would give caution to repay them if the contingent Covenants ſhould be broken. And ſo it was ſaid is the courſe in Chancery at this day in the like caſes. And <hi>Hales</hi> and <hi>Twiſden ex parte Defendentis</hi> argued to the contrary.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It was agreed by them, and alſo by the Court, that though the Legacies were deviſed in <hi>ſpecie,</hi> yet the Legatees could not take them without the aſſent of the Executors. And that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Caſe was the ſame as if the Legacies had been of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. Indeed there is a difference between theſe Legacies; for <hi>Legatum quantitatis eſt Legatario,</hi> as <hi>Legatum</hi> in <hi>ſpecie eſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. It was agreed, that if the Covenant had been broken before the delivery of the Legacies, the Adminiſtration would have wrought a <hi>Devaſtavit;</hi> but the Legacies being firſt delivered, it was agrued, that the Executors ought not to be charged in a <hi>Devaſtavit</hi> upon this Covenant.</p>
               <p n="1">1. From the nature of the thing it ſelf; for a Covenant is no Duty, nor cauſe of Action, till it be broken; and therefore is not diſcharged by a releaſe of Actions: And when it is broken, the Action is not founded meerly upon the ſpecialty, as if it were a Duty, but ſavours of Treſpaſs; and therefore an Accord is a good plea to it, and ends in damages.</p>
               <p n="2">2. From the qualification of it in reſpect of the contingency of the breach thereof; for it is to be preſumed, that it will be rather performed than broken.</p>
               <p n="3">3. From the inconvenience that ſuch a Covenant ſhould ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct the performance of the Will, for it is a preſent and certain miſchief, that Legacies ſhould not be paid; and it is but a poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and contingent miſchief that the Covenant ſhould be broken, and the Covenantee unſatisfied; and therefore admitting that it were in place where by cuſtome a <hi>rationabili parte bonorum</hi> would lie, it would be very hard that the Children ſhould expect, till it were known whether the Covenant would be broken or no, which may perchance continue in ſuſpenſe for ever; for ſuch Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants are commonly annext to Eſtates in fee. Now the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is the ſame in caſe of Legacies; for where it hath been ſaid
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:65497:24"/> that the Common Law takes no notice of them, ſo as to give remedy for them, it was anſwered,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the Law takes notice of a Legacy ſo as to create a Duty in the party to whom it is bequeathed, though he cannot take it without the aſſent of the Executors; for after ſuch aſſent the Law veſts the property of the thing bequeathed in the Legatee, and therefore a Condition impoſed upon the aſſent is void.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Probate and ordering of Wills did belong originally to the Iurisdiction of Temporal Courts, where the Legatees might have had remedy for their Legacies, as appears by <hi>Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, lib.</hi> 6. <hi>cap.</hi> 6, <hi>&amp;</hi> 7. where there is a Writ to demand a Lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy at the Common Law; and now that the Iurisdiction is devol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to the Eccleſiaſtical Court, the Common Law takes notice of the remedy there for Legacies; for the power of that Court is regulated by theſe, and therefore forbearance of Suit there hath been adjudged a good conſideration of a promiſe; and for the ſame reaſon <hi>Hale</hi> ſaid he conceived, that if an Executor of his own wrong paid Legacies, the rightfull Executor ſhould be bound thereby, becauſe he was compellable by Law to pay them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Though the Executor were not compellable by Law to pay the Legacies, yet now that payment is executed, the Law takes notice of it to veſt the property of the Goods in the Legatees. And this being before any Covenant broken, the Adminiſtration will be good. As to the Objection concerning proviſional pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Legacies, it was anſwered,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That it is the common caſe almoſt of all perſons that have any dealing in the Kingdom, to make ſuch Covenants, and to give Portions to their Children by Will, and this is all the maintenance many of them have; and therefore it is difficult for them to find ſecurity for the payment of that whereof they live.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Though the Eccleſiaſtical Court, in a prudential way, uſe ſometimes to take caution for repayment, yet they are not bound ſo to doe. And therefore this Court cannot take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice thereof.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It hath been agreed, that payment of Debts upon ſimple Contracts is a good adminiſtration againſt Iudgments defeaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble upon performance of Covenants; and yet the ſame proviſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal payment might be made in that caſe, but the Law doth not compell it, <hi>pur que, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the Caſe being thus argued, the laſt <hi>Trinity</hi> Term, and
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:65497:24"/> this Term, two Exceptions were taken by <hi>Bacon</hi> to the Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the Plaintiff hath not conveyed to himſelf a good Title to the Tenements, for he alledges a demiſe of them <hi>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bendum</hi> to the Plaintiff, but he is not named in the premiſes; but this was after agreed to be well enough, for a Leaſe ſo made is good. And <hi>Latch</hi> ſaid it had been ſo adjudged.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the breach was not well aſſigned, for the Covenant is againſt all perſons, claiming by the aſſent, means or procure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Sir <hi>Moulton;</hi> but the breach aſſigned is, that <hi>Clavel clamans titulum</hi> from Sir <hi>M.</hi> did enter, now he might claim Title from him, when as in truth he had no Title from him. And for this cauſe Iudgment was given againſt the Plaintiff. And the Iudges would not deliver their opinions upon the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in Law, but upon the Arguments. <hi>Roll</hi> did incline for the Plaintiff, upon the proviſional payment that might be made, and ſaid, that Prohibitions have been denied upon ſuggeſtion of a Suit in the Eccleſiaſtical Court, where contingent charges have been pleaded, becauſe this Court takes notice of proviſional pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which are uſed to be made there; alſo he approved of the diverſity between Debts without ſpecialty, and Legacies. And <hi>Bacon</hi> inclined to the Defendant for the reaſons before al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged.</p>

               <p>IN an Action of Debt by the Husband and Wife Executrix, upon a Bond ſuppoſed to be made to the Teſtator, <hi>non eſt factum</hi> being pleaded, it was found to be made to the Teſtator and another, who died before the Teſtator. And if it were his Deed <hi>modo &amp; forma prout, &amp;c.</hi> was referred to the Court. And <hi>Maynard</hi> argued for the Plaintiff.</p>
               <p n="1">1.<note place="margin">Inſt. 185. b.

<pb n="42" facs="tcp:65497:25"/> where two Iointenants were joyned in a Leaſe, and one relea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to the other in an Action of Waſte, he counted of a Leaſe made by himſelf only, and adjudged good. 46 <hi>E.</hi> 3. 17. <hi>c.</hi> 33 <hi>H.</hi> 6.<note place="margin">H. 6.

               <p n="2">2.

(Note the ſame Law holds where a charge ſurvives, as if two joyn in a Bond, the Obligee may have Debt againſt the one only; And it was no plea for him to ſay it was made by him and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, unleſs he ſay he is in full life, as appears 28 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 3. <hi>c. &amp; fu.</hi> 11. <hi>a.</hi>) But where nothing ſurvives, there the Caſe ought to be alledged as the truth was; as if two Iointenants make a Feoffment, and the one dies, the Feoffor cannot plead this as a Feoffment made by the ſurvivor only: Otherwiſe where a Feoff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is made to two, and one dies. 14 <hi>E.</hi> 4. 1. <hi>h.</hi>

               <p>IN an Action of Debt<note place="margin">Debt.</note> brought againſt an Executor upon a Leaſe for years made to the Teſtator for Rent due after his death in the <hi>detinet:</hi> after a Verdict for the Plaintiff <hi>quod deti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net,</hi> it was moved by <hi>Hales</hi> in arreſt of Iudgment that the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ought to have been in the <hi>debet</hi> and <hi>detinet</hi> for the reaſons in <hi>Hargrave</hi>'s Caſe, <hi>l.</hi> 5. 31. for nothing ſhall be Aſſets but the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pluſ. of the value of the Land exceeding the Rent. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the profits of the Land proportionable to the Rent are taken
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:65497:25"/> to his own uſe, and therefore he is to be charged as for his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Debt; and it cannot be preſumed that the Land ſhould be of no value, but contrarily that they ſhould be of greater value than the Rent. And therefore in an Avowry upon an Abbot for Rent he cannot diſclaim generally, unleſs he ſhew that the Land is of leſs value then the Rent. 43 <hi>Aſſ. pl.</hi> 23. 16 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 2. ſo that if the Land here had been worth nothing, or of leſs value than the Rent, the Plaintiff ought to have ſhewen it in his Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for this cannot be made up by the Verdict; for (beſides that the intendment is too remote to be ſupplied, for which ſee <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Somerland</hi>'s Caſe, <hi>ſu.</hi> 9. <hi>a.</hi>) the Verdict is true though it be otherwiſe; for he that is ſaid <hi>debere &amp; detinere</hi> may well be ſaid <hi>detinere.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The Executor is now charged as Ter-tenant, and not upon the privity of Contract with the Teſtator, and therefore the Action will not lie againſt him after Aſſignment; and for the ſame reaſon it ought to be brought where the Lands lies, ſo that he ought to be charged in the <hi>debet</hi> and <hi>detinet</hi> in reſpect of the Land and the profits, and not in the <hi>detinet,</hi> as upon the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract. But yet upon debate Iudgment was given for the Plaintiff, for the Executor demands his intereſt, whereby the Charge accrues from the Teſtator, ſo that he may anſwer the Rent out of the Teſtator's Eſtate, and the ſole inconvenience is to the Plaintiff himſelf, who waives his advantage to demand ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction out of the Eſtate of the Defendant, and contents him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with what the Teſtator's Eſtate will afford; and therefore it was never doubted but that the Action might be brought in the <hi>detinet</hi> only; but it hath been much doubted whether it might be in the <hi>debet</hi> and <hi>detinet.

            <p>Then another queſtion was made upon the Indictment, which is <hi>contra formam Statuti,</hi> and accordingly they were all found guilty by the Iury, whereas it appears that theſe are not guilty within the Statute: But it was anſwered and reſolved, that upon this Indictment they might all have been found guilty at the Common Law; then when all are found guilty within the Statute the Verdict ſhall be taken as it may ſtand by Law: And the ſubſtance of the Indictment be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing found the reſt is but ſurpluſage which hurteth not the Verdict: And the Court held that the Indictment need not conclude <hi>contra formam Statuti,</hi> becauſe the Statute doth not alter the nature of the offence, but only takes away the priviledge which the Common Law allowed in ſuch caſe; and therefore it is ſufficient that the circumſtances be expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the Indictment, whereby it may appear that the offence is within the Statute, and the Offendors had their Clergy, and upon their reading were burnt in the hand <hi>in conſpectu curiae.</hi>

                  <note place="margin">Ejectione firmae</note> upon a ſpecial Verdict upon not guilty pleaded, the Caſe was briefly thus. <hi>Walter Vaughan</hi> being ſeiſed in Fee of the Land in queſtion, deviſed it to <hi>Francis</hi> his el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt Son, and the Heirs males of his Body; the remainder to his ſecond Son, and the Heirs males of his Body, with other remainders; the remainder to the Heirs males of the Body of the Deviſor, provided if the eldeſt Son ſhould die without Iſſue male; but having Iſſue female, then I do give full power and authority to the ſaid Daughters to enter into the Lands, and to take the profits thereof untill he that firſt ſhall have the Lands, after the death of <hi>Francis,</hi> ſhall pay to each of them 400 <hi>li.</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their Marriage, and dies; <hi>Francis</hi> dies without Iſſue male, having a Daughter <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> who entred into the Lands, and died, the 400 <hi>li.</hi> being unpaid; her Adminiſtrator enters, and Leaſes to the Plaintiff, upon whom the younger Son of the Deviſor enters, and him ejects; and if upon the whole matter the entry of the Adminiſtrator was lawfull, they find for the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff: And the queſtion in Law was, what Eſtate <hi>Elizabeth</hi> had, and it was argued by <hi>Hale, Maynard</hi> and <hi>Brown</hi> for the Plaintiff.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That ſhe had an intereſt;<note place="margin">5 H. 7. 1. a. 27 H. 8. 16. 1. Dyer 210. d. Br. Deviſe 48.</note> for an authority to take the profits implies as much as a deviſe of the profits, which gives an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is a Chattel, like to the caſe where a feoffment is made rendring Rent, with proviſo that if it be arrear, the Feoffor may enter and hold the Land till it be paid; this gives a Chattel to the Feoffor: And ſo it is if the arrears were to be ſatisfied out of the profits of the land: And ſo it is in caſe of a deviſe to Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors till debts be paid. And ſo <hi>Brown</hi> ſaid it was reſolved in a Caſe between <hi>Eire</hi> and <hi>Haggard, Hil.</hi> 13 <hi>Jac. Rot.</hi> 868. <hi>C. B.</hi> where a Rent was granted out of the Lands, and if the Rent were behind, that the Grantor might enter into the Land and hold it till he were paid, that this was but a Chattel.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It was argued that this Chattel was tranſmiſſible to the Adminiſtrator, becauſe if the portion it ſelf had been deviſed, though it were toward Marriage, it would have gone to the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrator: Now though the profits of the Land are but a gage till the portion be paid, yet it follows the Portion; as 20 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 1. <hi>a.</hi> as if a <hi>nomine poenae</hi> deſcend to the Heir with the Rent, ſo if Lands
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:65497:27"/> are deviſed to Executors for payment of Debts, it goes to their Executors; and the Executors of Tenant by <hi>Elegit</hi> ſhall have an Aſſiſe, for the remedy goes with the duty, 2 <hi>Inſt.</hi> 396. <hi>e.</hi> And in this caſe if it ſhould not be ſo, the Portion might not be paid, which were contrary to the meaning and letter of the Will; for there is an expreſs proviſo, that the Lands ſhall not remain over till the money be paid; and <hi>Twiſden</hi> and <hi>St. John,</hi> Sollicitor, argued to the contrary. But <hi>St. John</hi> did admit it to be an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, but that it was no Chattell.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe the deviſe is found to be in purſuance of Articles of agreement made for the like ſettlement to be made by the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtator in his life-time, but if ſuch a ſettlement had been made in his life, it would have given a Freehold for life, and not a Chattel.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The deviſe was for advancement of Daughters, and it is found by the Verdict that 1200 Acres of Land are deviſed, in which, if the Daughters ſhould have an Eſtate for life, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but be intended to be as great or greater advancement, than if 400 <hi>li.</hi> only had been deviſed to them; and yet that the Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor lookt upon as a ſufficient proviſion: And therefore made the Eſtate determinable upon payment of that.</p>

It cannot be thought that the Teſtator intended to give the whole Land to the Daughters, and to debar the Iſſue male of his younger Sons; and yet as this Will is penned, if it ſhould not give a Freehold, then if the firſt man dies before payment, the Daughters ſhold have it for ever; and <hi>Dyer</hi> 300 <hi>h.</hi> was ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. And for this cauſe alſo it cannot be a Chattel; for there cannot be a perpetuity of a Chattel upon no ſuppoſal; and therefore there is no more reaſon to ſay it ſhould be a Fee in them than a Chattel. 2.

<pb n="47" facs="tcp:65497:27"/> was anſwered, that this was in caſe of a Vſe, which was then ruled meerly according to equity, and by expreſs words it was limited to the Executors; and there it was for money paid by the Covenantee, and ſo for a Duty which goes to the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors. And for the caſe of a Deviſe to Executors for payment of Debts, there it is a Chattel in them which goes to their Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, becauſe otherwiſe Debts ſhould not be paid, which is the ſpecial reaſon of that caſe, for ſuch an Eſtate made by Grant will be an Eſtate for life, <hi>l.</hi> 8. 96. <hi>c.</hi> And in the caſe of retaining Land till a Rent be paid, there the Land is taken but as a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs, till the Rent which is a duty iſſuing out of it, be paid; but in our caſe neither the perſon nor the Land is Debtor, for no Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacy is deviſed to the Daughters, the Deviſe is only that they ſhall hold the Lands untill, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And it had been all one caſe if it had been made determinable upon any other limitation, as upon payment of money; alſo in all thoſe Caſes the Intereſt is determinable ſome way or other; but in our caſe it ſhould be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual upon the contingency aforeſaid.</p>

               <p>But to that it was replied, that the Statute 8 <hi>H.</hi> 6. goes on and provides, that in caſe of forcible Detainer, after complaint made to the Iuſtices of Peace, they ſhall cauſe the Statute of 15 <hi>R.</hi> 2. to be duly executed; by which Statute the Offendor is to be fined and impriſoned; ſo that this Statute grants only reſtitution, and refers the other puniſhment to the Statute of 15 <hi>R.</hi> 2.

               <p n="1">1. That an actual Deviſe by word is no ſufficient ground for a ſtranger to write the Will, but there ought to be an Actual Will, and deſire that it ſhould be written, and a bare wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is not ſufficient, but there ought to be an actual willing.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That this deſire ought to be in ſome ſhort ſpace after the Deviſe, ſo that it be as one continued act; for if the Deviſe be at one time, and at another time the Deviſor ſends for one to write his Will, a new Declaration will be neceſſary to make it effectual.</p>

For that the Plaintiff hath alledged that he was ready to joyn in a Surrender with the Defendant, and that then and there he did require the Defendant to Surrender, but hath not alledged that he did give notice to the Defendant that he was ready to joyn with him; and ſo it is no more then a bare requeſt to the Defendant to make a Surrender, which is not ſufficient, for that the Plaintiff was to joyn with him in it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Surrender was to be for Sale to be made to <hi>J.

               <p n="3">3. The Promiſe is general to joyn in a Surrender, and the Requeſt is to Surrender into the hands of two Cuſtomary Tenants, which being a particular way of Surrender ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

<pb n="70" facs="tcp:65497:39"/> was moved in arreſt of Iudgment, wherein the queſtion was, Whether this amendment were in a point material; for it was agréed that if it were not in a material part of the Declaration, then it could not prejudice the Plaintiff.

               <p n="2">2. The Promiſe is to perform what the Arbitrators ſhould award, which muſt be taken with relation to the ſubmiſſion, which was to an award to be made within a month. And ſo the words <hi>infra unum menſem,</hi> are but an expreſſion of that which would have béen implyed without them. But it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved by <hi>Roll</hi> upon good deliberation, that the amendment was in a material part; For</p>
               <p n="1">1. Though a ſubmiſſion to an Award be good Evidence to induce a Iury to find a Promiſe to perform it, yet in Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Law the Promiſe is collateral to the ſubmiſſion, and not implyed in it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Though the Promiſe be collateral to the ſubmiſſion, yet if it had béen laid to have béen made at the ſame time with it, then it ſhould have béen intended adequate and proportionable to it; but being laid to be made at another time, although it be the ſame day, it cannot be ſo intended, becauſe it is not imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately applyed to the ſubmiſſion, but it might have inlarg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or abridged the time limited thereby. And he cited a Caſe betwéen <hi>Hodge</hi> and <hi>Vavaſour,</hi> 14 <hi>Jac.</hi> where the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff declared, that the Defendant ſuch a day became indebted to him for Wares, and in conſideration thereof, <hi>poſtea eo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem die,</hi> promiſed to pay it: And this was ruled good, not as a promiſe in Law, but as an actual promiſe raiſed upon a conſideration continuing; which he cited to ſhew that a little diſtance of time (though the ſame day) alters the intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Law, and a new Trial was awarded.</p>

               <p>IN an Action of Debt<note place="margin">Debt.</note> againſt an Executrix, the Plaintiff declared upon a Leaſe made to the Teſtator by Indenture dated the 25 of <hi>March, Anno. Habendum à die datus</hi> for Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven years; And upon <hi>Nil debet</hi> pleaded, the Iury found that the Plaintiff by Indenture dated the 25 of <hi>March,</hi> and delivered the ſame day, demiſed the Land to the Teſtator, which was to have and to hold from the day of the date, for the tearm of Seven years from henceforth next and immediately following, &amp;c. And upon this Verdict the Queſtion was, Whether the Leaſe, in point of Computation, was to commence from the making, or from the day of the Date; For if the Seven years commenced from the making, then the Plaintiff had miſtaken the Leaſe; but if they commenced from the day of the Date, then he had declared right, according to the Leaſe. And it was argued, that the Seven years were to commence from the day
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:65497:42"/> of the Date, and not from the making of the Leaſe, for that the words will bear that conſtruction; for the words <hi>from hence forth</hi> may refer to the words <hi>from the day of the Date,</hi> and ſo to the time of the commencement in point of intereſt. And then the words ſhall be taken as if the Leaſe had béen to have and to hold from the day of the date from henceforth for Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven years, excluding the day of the Date in the computation, and this was probably the intention of the parties; and not that the Leaſe ſhould commence one day in point of computa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the next day in intereſt: Alſo there is a Rent reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved during the tearm payable annually upon the 25 of <hi>March,</hi> the laſt day of payment whereof would be out of the tearm, if the Seven years commence upon that day. And the Caſe in <hi>Dyer</hi> 261. was cited, where an Abbot made a Leaſe for 31. years, and after made a new Leaſe in theſe words, <hi>Noveritis nos &amp;c. dictis</hi> 31. <hi>annis finitis et completis dediſſe, &amp; conceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſſe praed' praemiſſa</hi> (to the ſecond Leſſée) <hi>habend'et tenend' à die confectionis praeſentium (termin' praed' finit') uſque ad finem termini</hi> 31. <hi>annorum tunc immediate ſequentium.</hi> And it is there reſolved by all the Iuſtices of <hi>C. B.</hi> that the Leaſe doth not commence in point of computation, till it takes ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in Intereſt, <hi>viz.</hi> till the firſt 31. years ended. And yet there it might have béen ſaid, that the words <hi>praed' termino finito</hi> ſhould be a limitation in point of Poſſeſſion or Intereſt; and the words <hi>à die confectionis &amp;c.</hi> in point of computation. But there it is ſaid, that the words, <hi>à die confectionis,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to the Demiſe after the 31. years ended, to have <hi>à die confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionis.</hi> But note in that Caſe the Opinion of the Court of the <hi>Kings Bench</hi> was againſt that Opinion. And in this Caſe two other points were moved and agreed by <hi>Roll;</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. That where part of the Arrears demanded were due in the time of the Teſtator, and part after his deceaſe, the Action in the <hi>Detinet</hi> was good for the whole, as well as if all had béen due after the death of the Teſtator. And that after a Verdict, <hi>Quod non detinet,</hi> the Land ſhall not be intended of any value, as it is well known in theſe times, in many places Lands have béen of no value, and yet the Executor is liable to the Rent as far as he hath Aſſets; and clearly if he hath Aſſets he cannot wave his tearm.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the Action being in the <hi>Detinet,</hi> and the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant pleading <hi>Nil debet,</hi> it is holpen by a Verdict. And ſo it was adjudged, as he ſaid in this Court, <hi>Trin.</hi> 10 <hi>Car. Rot.</hi>
                  <pb n="77" facs="tcp:65497:42"/> 1289. betwéen <hi>Porter</hi> and <hi>Gerviſe.</hi> And he ſaid, If in an Action upon the Caſe upon an Aſſumpſit, the Defendant plead Not Guilty, it is well enough after a Verdict, and as there your Action is <hi>placitum trn<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s ſuper caſum,</hi> ſo here it is <hi>placitum debiti.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to the principal point, he did reſolve, That the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff hath miſtaken his Leaſe; for a Leaſe <hi>Habendum,</hi> from henceforth, includes the day of the making; and a Leaſe <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bendum,</hi> from the day of the day excludes the day of the date. And with this agrées <hi>Barwick's</hi> Caſe, which he affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be Law; (but he ſaid, That if ſuch ancient Patents be given in Evidence, the Iury by preſumption to make the Patents good, may find that they were made the laſt inſtant of the day of their Date, and then they are good in Law: And ſo hath it béen reſolved in point of Evidence.) Now the <hi>Habendum</hi> being <hi>à die datus,</hi> and for Seven years from hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth, &amp;c. to make all parts of it ſtand, it muſt be conſtrued to commence from henceforth, <hi>viz.</hi> as to the computation of the Seven years, that they ſhall begin upon the 25 of <hi>March,</hi> and from the day of the date, <hi>viz.</hi> upon the 26 of <hi>March</hi> in intereſt and poſſeſſion. And he reſembled it to the Caſe of <hi>More</hi> and <hi>Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave, Hobart</hi> 18. which was cited by <hi>Hale,</hi> who ſaid he had ſéen the Record of it, and it is entred <hi>Mich.</hi> 10 <hi>Jac. rot.</hi> 76. <hi>in Scacar.</hi> where the Plaintiff in an <hi>Ejectione firmae</hi> declared, that <hi>J. S.</hi> 5 <hi>Maij</hi> 10. <hi>Jac.</hi> Demiſed a Houſe to him <hi>Haben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum,</hi> from the Feaſt of <hi>Annunciation</hi> laſt paſt, for 21 years <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunc proxime ſequent<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> And the Defendant the ſame 5. of <hi>May</hi> ejected him, and upon <hi>Non cul.</hi> the Iury found that the ſaid <hi>J.S.</hi> the ſaid 5. day of <hi>May,</hi> by Indenture bearing date the 4. of <hi>May,</hi> demiſed the Houſe to the Plaintiff, To have and to hold from the Feaſt of the <hi>Annunciation</hi> laſt paſt, for and during the tearm of 21 years, next enſuing the date hereof, fully to be compleat and ended. And upon that Verdict the Plaintiff had Iudgment, which was affirmed there; alſo in which caſe the tearm began from the Feaſt of the <hi>Annunciation</hi> in computation of the 21 years, and upon the 5. of <hi>May</hi> in point of Intereſt. But <hi>Roll</hi> agréed that if in the principal Caſe the Leaſe had béen made To have and to hold from the day of the date from henceforth for Seven years, then the Plaintiff had declared right. And Iudgment was given againſt the Plaintiff: <hi>Hale</hi> for the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff, <hi>Twiſden</hi> for the Defendant.</p>

               <p n="2">2. The word Grain is certain enough, for that it is expreſſed to be ſowen upon a certain number of Acres.

               <p>IN a Trover and Converſion of 400 Load of Timber: Vpon not guilty pleaded, the Iury found by ſpecial Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict, that Sir <hi>William Udal</hi> being ſeized in fée of the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of <hi>Horton,</hi> whereof the Land where the Timber grew was parcel, did Covenant by Indenture to levy a Fine to the uſe of himſelf in Tail, the Remainder to ſuch perſons and for ſuch Eſtates as he ſhould limit by Indenture, and for want of ſuch limitation, the remainder to the Defendant for life, the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to his eldeſt Son in Tail, and to his tenth Son, and for want of ſuch Iſſue, the remainder to <hi>W. U.</hi> for life, the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to his eldeſt Son in Tail, &amp;c. and ſo to his tenth Son, the remainder to the right heirs of Sir <hi>William,</hi> with a <hi>Proviſo</hi> that upon tender of 5 <hi>s.</hi> &amp;c. he might revoke thoſe uſes and limit others, and levyed a fine accordingly. And after by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Indenture reciting the uſes of the firſt and the <hi>Proviſo</hi> in it, made a new limitation to the uſe of himſelf in tail, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder to the Defendant for life, with like remainder, <hi>ut ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pra,</hi> to his Sons, the remainder to <hi>W. U.</hi> for life, with like remainders to his Sons, the remainder to the Plaintiff in Tail, &amp;c. <hi>according to his power and the clauſe in the ſaid In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentures,</hi> and dyed without Iſſue, and the Defendant (neither himſelf nor <hi>W. U.</hi> having any Son) cut down the Timber and — years after ſold part of it, and the Plaintiff ſeiſed the reſt, which the Defendant did take again from the Plaintiff, and ſold the ſame, and if, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And (the caſe being argued <hi>Trin. Paſch. ult.</hi> and this Term) it was reſolved by <hi>Bacon</hi> and <hi>Roll.</hi> 1. That if there be tenant for life, the remainder for life, and tenant for life cut down Timber trées, he that hath the Inheritance may ſeiſe them, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he cannot have an Action of waſte during the life of him in remainder; For 1. The particular tenant hath not the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute property in the Trées, but only a ſpecial Intereſt in them ſo long as they continue annexed to the Land. And therefore a Termer cannot grant away his term excepting the trées, but the exception is void, for that he cannot have a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct intereſt in them but only relative to the land. And ſo it
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:65497:45"/> is reſolved in <hi>Sanders</hi> Caſe <hi>Lib.</hi> 5. 12. <hi>f.</hi> (and ſo <hi>Mainard</hi> ſaid) it was reſolved 10 <hi>Car.</hi> in <hi>Whites</hi> caſe, in the Court of Wards, in caſe of leſſeé for life; but where a Leaſe for years was made without Impeachment of waſte, ſuch an exception was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged good (as he ſaid) in Sir <hi>Alan Piercy's</hi> Caſe, and ſo <hi>Bacon</hi> ſaid it was adjudged 9 <hi>Car.</hi> in Dame <hi>Billinglys</hi> Caſe. Then the remainder for life betters not the intereſt of the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant for life in the Trées, but only is an impediment for the time to the bringing of an Action of waſte; and therefore af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the death of him in remainder for life, an Action will lye for waſte done in his life time. And ſo it is adjudged in <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets</hi> Caſe, <hi>Lib.</hi> 5. 76. <hi>g.</hi> and ſo (<hi>Mainard</hi> ſaid) it was adjudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Mich.</hi> 14 <hi>E.</hi> 2. in a Caſe not Printed, that where he in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion upon an eſtate for life granted his reverſion for life, and the tenant for life made waſte, and then the grantée of the reverſion dyed, that an Action of waſte would lye againſt the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant for life, which proves that the cutting down of the Trées by the Tenant was tortious.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It was reſolved that the mean remainders in contingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, though of an eſtate inheritance, alter not the caſe, for an eſtate in contingency is no eſtate till the contingency happen: And therefore it was agréed that the Plaintiff might have had an Action of waſte in this Caſe, had there not béen a remainder for life <hi>in eſſe,</hi> notwithſtanding the mean contingent remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It was reſolved that a Trover and Converſion in this Caſe would lye for all the Timber trées though the Plaintiff never ſeized parcel of them, for by the cutting down of them an abſolute property was veſted in the Plaintiff, unleſs they had béen cut down for reparations and ſo imployed in conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient time. And for this <hi>Bury</hi> and <hi>Heards</hi> Caſe was cited by the Court, which commenced in this Court 20 <hi>Jac.</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended ſeven years, where a ſtranger entred into Lands leaſed for life and cut down Timber trées and barked them, and the leſſor before ſeiſure brought a Trover for the bark and had Iudgment to recover, notwithſtanding that the cutting down and barking was all at one time; whereupon it was then objected that the diſtinct property of a chattle was never ſettled in the leſſor, and the book of 13 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 9. <hi>g.</hi> cited, that Treſpaſs <hi>vi &amp; armis</hi> doth not lye againſt leſſée for years who cuts down Timber trées and ſells them. <hi>Per Curiam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which Caſe was then affirmed for good Law, but there it was agréed, That if leſſée for years cuts down Timber trees
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:65497:45"/> and lets them lye, and after carries them away, ſo that the taking and carrying away be not as one continued act, but that there be ſome time for the diſtinct property of a divided chattle to ſettle in the leſſor, that an Action of Treſpaſs <hi>vi &amp; armis</hi> would lye in ſuch caſe againſt the leſſee. And that in ſuch caſe felony might be committed of them, but not where they were taken and carried away at the ſame time. <hi>Vide</hi> 3 <hi>In.</hi> 109. <hi>a. c.</hi> 4. 63. <hi>f.</hi> And it was reſolved in that Caſe of <hi>Bury</hi> and <hi>Heard,</hi> that although the leſſee had a ſpecial Intereſt in the trees as for neceſſary reparations, &amp;c. yet the Action would lye for the leſſor, for the Intereſt of the leſſee was determined by the cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting down, unleſs he had cauſe for neceſſary reparations, which had there been, yet might the leſſor have his Action; but if the leſſee in ſuch caſe had brought his Action and recovered, this would have been a good bar againſt the leſſor: but in the principal caſe there was years diſtance between the cutting down and the ſale. And alſo the Defendant by the ſale made himſelf an abſolute wrong doer, for though there had been cauſe for reparation, yet the Trees being cut down and ſold, though other Trees had been bought with the money and imployed in reparations, this would not have excuſed him in an Action of Waſte.</p>
               <p>And an exception was taken by <hi>Latch</hi> to the execution of the power of Sir <hi>William</hi> upon the limitation of the uſes by the laſt Indenture, for that it was made with relation to the <hi>Proviſo.</hi> And five ſhillings were not tendered, which was the Condition of the power thereby reſerved, and then Sir <hi>William</hi> being tenant in Tail, the reverſion to himſelf in fee, by the firſt Indenture, and dying without Iſſue, the Defendant being his heir was ſeiſed in fee; but the exception was clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſallowed, both for that he had a double power by the firſt Indenture, the one to limit other uſes to ſuch perſons and for ſuch eſtates as he pleaſed, the other to revoke the uſes limited by the firſt Indenture, and to limit new uſes. And when he limits uſes generally which cannot ſtand by the power reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the <hi>Proviſo</hi> for lack of tender, the Law will refer the limitation to the power he had to limit other uſes, &amp;c. And Sir <hi>Edw. Clears</hi> Caſe, <hi>Lib.</hi> 6. 18. was cited. And ſecondly, for that the ſecond limitation is expreſly made <hi>according to his power,</hi> which refers to that power which he perſued: And it was touched whether the uſes limited according to that power were revocable by the <hi>Proviſo.</hi> And <hi>Mainard</hi> ſaid it might be
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:65497:46"/> a queſtion. And Iudgment was given for the Plaintiff. <hi>Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard</hi> for the Plaintiff and <hi>Latch</hi> for the Defendant.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quaere</hi> in the caſe cited if a leſſor ſhould bring Trover againſt a ſtranger for Trees cut by him, if this ſhould be a bar to an Action of Waſte for the Trees. And if there were cauſe for reparations, what remedy hath the leſſee for his loſs, for it ſhould ſeem that he will be liable to an Action of Waſte for not repairing, although the leſſor recovers for the Trees.</p>

               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="86" facs="tcp:65497:47"/>1. Whether upon this Iſſue the ſubmiſſion be in queſtion?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Admitting it be, whether the award upon the ſubmiſſion found be a good award? <hi>Et Term.

And this Term by <hi>Hale</hi> for the Plaintiff and <hi>Mainard</hi> for the Defendant. And it was reſolved by <hi>Bacon</hi> and <hi>Roll.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. That upon this Iſſue the Iury cannot enquire of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, for that is admitted by the plea. And therefore the Defendant could not have ſet this matter forth in the rejoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, thereby to have made good his bar; that the Arbitrators made no award, for the award in it ſelf is a good award. And it would have been a departure in him to have alledged a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter extrinſecal to the award, which ſhould prove it to be void; and for this <hi>Lincy</hi> and <hi>Aſhtons</hi> Caſe 12 <hi>Car.</hi> in this Court was cited by <hi>Roll,</hi> where in debt upon a bond to perform an award, upon <hi>nullum fecerunt arbitrium</hi> pleaded, the Plaintiff ſet forth an award that the Defendant ſhould pay 10 <hi>l.</hi> to the Plaintiff at the houſe of a ſtranger, and Aſſigned breach in non-payment; the Defendant rejoyned that he could not come to the ſtrangers houſe without being a Treſpaſſer: and upon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murrer it was adjudged for the Plaintiff;<note place="margin">39 H. 6. 6. h. Lib. 5. 103.</note> for the award ſet forth by the Plaintiff was good; and the matter alledged by the Defendant in avoidance of it, was a departure from his bar. And therefore he ought to have alledged the whole matter in his bar. And ſo muſt he have done in this Caſe if he would have taken advantage of the ſubmiſſion; and he ſaid, that 14 <hi>Car.</hi> Iudgment was affirmed in the Exchequer, and both points reſolved accordingly.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Againſt the award it was objected, that thereby the bond made by the Plaintiff to the Defendant ſhould be releaſed, but the Defendants bond ſhould ſtand; for the award, that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſes ſhould be made of all Actions, &amp;c. till the eighth of <hi>March,</hi> is entire, and cannot be apportioned in reſpect of time, that is, bind as to the time before the firſt bond, and be void as to the time after.</p>
               <p>But it was reſolved, that the award in this Caſe was a good award; for the award that all Suits between the parties ſhould ceaſe, is a good award on both ſides and ſufficient ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction for the money ordered to be paid by the Defendant; and then though the award be void as to the Releaſes, it is not
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:65497:47"/> material; and the Caſe betwéen <hi>Vanbore</hi> and <hi>Trigge,</hi> 14 <hi>Jac.</hi> in this Caſe was cited, where an award that all Suits betwéen the parties ſhould ceaſe, and that they ſhould make mutual Releaſes one to the other till the day of the award, was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged good as to the firſt part, and void for the Releaſes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thereby the bond of ſubmiſſion ſhould be releaſed; but where the award is, that they ſhall make general Releaſes without fixing to any time, this will be good, becauſe it ſhall be conſtrued to the time of the ſubmiſſion only.</p>
               <p>And it was agréed, that the miſrecital of the Arbitrators doth not prejudice their award. And it was touched by the Defendants Counſel, that the ſubmiſſion was void, becauſe at ſeveral times, but not inſiſted on; for the Court held it clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be good. And an exception was taken to the Verdict, for that they have not found the award to be made before <hi>Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> and the Court cannot take notice <hi>ex officio,</hi> that the 15 of <hi>April</hi> was before <hi>Eaſter:</hi> But to that it was anſwered, that the Plaintiff in his replication hath alledged it to be before the Feaſt of <hi>Eaſter, viz.</hi> 15 <hi>April.</hi> And the Defendant in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joynder hath omitted the words <hi>ante feſtum Paſchae,</hi> ſo that the time is not in Iſſue. And upon this reaſon Mr. <hi>Hales</hi> told me the Court reſted for that point, for he held that the Court otherwiſe could not take notice of the time <hi>ex officio,</hi> though Mr. <hi>Weſton</hi> ſaid, that the opinion of <hi>Roll</hi> was, that they might if they pleaſed. And Iudgment was given for the Plaintiffs in my abſence, through ſickneſs; but their Opinions were declared, <hi>ut ſupra,</hi> before.</p>
